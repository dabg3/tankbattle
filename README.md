# Tank Battle

Made with SDL2


## Build

Configure 
```shell
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug 
```

Compile
```shell
cd build
make 
```

Run all test suites
```shell
make test
```


## Project layout 

* `include` - headers
* `src`     - implementations
* `tests`   - test suites
* `unity`   - test framework


## LSP Integration

Language servers require the source file list and their compilation command lines.
Those are obtained by reading a `compile_commands.json` file generated by the build system.

```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -B build
ln -s build/compile_commands.json .
```


## TODO
* draw something moving
